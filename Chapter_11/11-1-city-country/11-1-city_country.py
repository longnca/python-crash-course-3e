"""Write a function that accepts two parameters: a city name and a country name.
The function should return a single string of the form City, Country, such as 
Santiago, Chile. Store the function in a module called city_functions.py,
and save this file in a new folder so pytest won't try to run the tests we've already written.

Create a file called test_cities.py that tests the function you just wrote.
Write a function called test_city_country() to verify that calling your function 
with values such as 'santiago' and 'chile' results in the correct string. 
Run the test, and make sure test_city_country() passes.
