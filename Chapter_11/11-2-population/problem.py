"""Modify your function so it requires a third parameter, 'population'.
It should now return a single string of the form City, Country - population xxx,
such as Santiago, Chile - population 5000000.
Run the test again, and make sure test_city_country() fails this time.
Modify the function so the population parameter is optional. Run the test, and
make sure test_city_country() passes again.
Write a second test called test_city_country_population() that verifies you can
call your function with the values 'santiago', 'chile', and 'population = 5000000'.
Run the tests one more time, and make sure this new test passes.
